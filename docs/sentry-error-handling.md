# Sentry SDK Error Handling and Prevention

## üîç Problem Analysis

### Error Description
The error you encountered is a **Sentry SDK transport error** that occurs when the Sentry SDK fails to send telemetry data to Sentry's servers:

```
Internal error in sentry_sdk
urllib3.exceptions.ProtocolError: ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response'))
```

### Root Causes
1. **Network Connectivity Issues**: Connection drops between your application and Sentry servers
2. **Long-Running Applications**: Connection pools become stale after periods of inactivity
3. **Sentry Server Issues**: Temporary unavailability or maintenance on Sentry's infrastructure
4. **Firewall/Proxy Interference**: Network infrastructure dropping long-lived connections
5. **Connection Timeouts**: Default timeouts may be too aggressive for your network conditions

### When This Occurs
- After applications have been idle for extended periods ("after a long time rest")
- During network instability or connectivity issues
- When Sentry's infrastructure experiences temporary issues
- In environments with aggressive firewall or proxy settings

## ‚úÖ Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Filtering (`before_send` method)
```python
def before_send(self, event: Event, hint: dict[str, Any]) -> Event | None:
    # Filter out Sentry SDK internal errors to prevent error loops
    if event.get("logger") == "sentry_sdk.errors":
        return None
        
    # Filter out network-related errors that are likely transient
    exception = event.get("exception")
    if exception and exception.get("values"):
        for exc_value in exception["values"]:
            exc_type = exc_value.get("type", "")
            exc_value_str = exc_value.get("value", "")
            
            # Skip common network errors that are transient
            if any(error_type in exc_type for error_type in [
                "RemoteDisconnected", "ProtocolError", "ConnectionError", 
                "TimeoutError", "ConnectTimeout", "ReadTimeout"
            ]):
                return None
    return event
```

### 2. Safe Sentry Operations (`capture_it` function)
```python
async def capture_it(obj: Exception | str) -> None:
    try:
        # Only attempt to send to Sentry if it's properly initialized
        if not is_initialized():
            logger.debug("Sentry not initialized, skipping capture")
            return
            
        # ... capture logic ...
    except Exception as e:
        # Don't let Sentry errors crash the application
        logger.warning(f"Failed to send event to Sentry (non-critical): {e}")
```

### 3. Improved Teardown Handling
```python
async def teardown(self) -> bool:
    try:
        client = get_client()
        if client and is_initialized():
            # Flush with configurable timeout to avoid hanging
            client.flush(timeout=max(1.0, self.shutdown_timeout - 2.0))
            client.close(timeout=2.0)
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        # Don't let Sentry teardown errors crash application shutdown
        logger.warning(f"Non-critical error during Sentry shutdown: {e}")
        return True  # Return True to not block application shutdown
```

### 4. Configurable Transport Settings
New environment variables for better control:

```bash
# Transport settings for better error handling
SENTRY_TIMEOUT=10           # Request timeout in seconds
SENTRY_RETRIES=3           # Number of retries for failed requests
SENTRY_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT=5  # Timeout for graceful shutdown
```

### 5. Enhanced Sentry Initialization
```python
_ = init(
    dsn=self.dsn,
    # ... other settings ...
    shutdown_timeout=self.shutdown_timeout,
    max_breadcrumbs=50,  # Limit breadcrumbs to reduce payload size
    attach_stacktrace=True,
    auto_session_tracking=False,  # Reduce network calls
)
```

### 6. Logger Configuration Updates
Added Sentry-related loggers to the ignore list to prevent log spam:

```python
"ignore": [
    "sentry_sdk.errors",
    "sentry_sdk.transport", 
    "urllib3.connectionpool",
    # ... other ignored loggers
],
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Prevention Strategies

### 1. **Graceful Degradation**
- Application continues to function even when Sentry is unavailable
- Errors are logged locally when Sentry transport fails
- No application crashes due to Sentry issues

### 2. **Error Loop Prevention**
- Sentry SDK internal errors are filtered out
- Transport errors don't generate new Sentry events
- Prevents infinite error reporting loops

### 3. **Network Resilience**
- Configurable timeouts and retries
- Transient network errors are filtered out
- Graceful handling of connection drops

### 4. **Resource Management**
- Proper cleanup during application shutdown
- Configurable shutdown timeouts
- Memory-efficient breadcrumb management

## üìä Monitoring and Debugging

### Environment Variables to Monitor
```bash
# Check current Sentry configuration
echo $SENTRY_DSN
echo $SENTRY_TIMEOUT
echo $SENTRY_RETRIES
echo $SENTRY_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT
```

### Log Messages to Watch For
- `"Sentry not initialized, skipping capture"` - Normal when Sentry is disabled
- `"Failed to send event to Sentry (non-critical)"` - Transport issues detected
- `"Detected Sentry transport issue"` - Network problems identified
- `"Filtered out transient network error"` - Error filtering working correctly

### Health Check Integration
The Sentry manager includes health checks that report:
- Configuration status
- Initialization status  
- Overall health status

## üîß Configuration Recommendations

### Development Environment
```bash
SENTRY_DSN=""  # Disable Sentry in development
SENTRY_TIMEOUT=5
SENTRY_RETRIES=1
```

### Production Environment
```bash
SENTRY_DSN="https://your-dsn@sentry.io/project"
SENTRY_TIMEOUT=10
SENTRY_RETRIES=3
SENTRY_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT=5
SENTRY_TRACE_SAMPLE_RATE=0.1
SENTRY_PROFILES_SAMPLE_RATE=0.1
```

### High-Traffic Environment
```bash
SENTRY_TIMEOUT=15
SENTRY_RETRIES=2
SENTRY_TRACE_SAMPLE_RATE=0.01  # Lower sampling for high traffic
SENTRY_PROFILES_SAMPLE_RATE=0.01
```

## üéØ Key Benefits

1. **Application Stability**: Sentry issues never crash your application
2. **Reduced Noise**: Transient network errors are filtered out
3. **Better Performance**: Configurable timeouts prevent hanging
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Application works with or without Sentry
5. **Easy Debugging**: Clear log messages for troubleshooting
6. **Production Ready**: Robust error handling for production environments

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Monitor Logs**: Watch for the new log messages to understand Sentry behavior
2. **Adjust Timeouts**: Fine-tune timeout values based on your network conditions
3. **Review Sampling**: Adjust sample rates based on your traffic and Sentry quota
4. **Test Scenarios**: Verify behavior during network outages or Sentry downtime
5. **Update Monitoring**: Include Sentry health status in your monitoring dashboards

The implemented solutions ensure that Sentry transport errors like the one you encountered will be handled gracefully without impacting your application's stability or performance.
